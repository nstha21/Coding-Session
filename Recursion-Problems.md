# Recursion

## Type of problems that recursion involves:
- Usually used in problems in which involve solving smaller subset of problems
- Divide and Conquer
- Backtracking
- Graph Problems (Finding path, Searching, etc)
- etc

## Some practice problems

1. Find factorial of n using recursion
2. Find nth fibonacci using recursion
3. [Recursive digit sum](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/recursive-digit-sum/problem)
4. Check if a number is a palindrome using recursion (palindrome is a number which reads the same backward as forward, ex: 6, 121, 12421 is palindromes)
